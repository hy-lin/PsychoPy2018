## Exercise

- 6 squares on the screen.
    - five of them rotating at the same direction
    - one of them rotating at the opposite direction
- Participants have to click on the square rotating at the wrong direction
- Record RT and correctness.

## Exercise

- First is to decide which square to rotate differently.
```{python}
target = 3 # third square is the target
```
- Then decide which direction is the normal roration and which is the special one.
```{python}
normal_orientation = 1
```
- Make squares rorate differently.
```{python}
    for i in range(6):
        if i == target-1:
            rects[i].ori = orientation * normal_orientation * -1
        else:
            rects[i].ori = orientation * normal_orientation
```

## Exercise

- Get mouse click
```{python}
        if mouse.isPressedIn(rects[i], buttons = [0]):
            rects[i].fillColor = (255, 0, 0)
            response = i+1
```
- Check correctness and RT
```{python}
correctness = response == target
RT = psychopy.core.getTime() - t0

print([response, correctness, RT])
```

## Composing a Trial

- What's the common procedure between trials
- What's the information required in a trial

- Rotating squares example:
    - Always 6 squares
    - Rotation direction varies from trial to trial
    - Target varies from trial to trial
    
## Function

- Let you do things repeatiedly but slightly differently with different input arguement
```{python}
def function_name(arg1, arg2, ...):
    # define a function called function_name.
    print('in a funtion')
    
function_name(1, 2)
```
- Importantly, function has it's own space
- Create a function for runing a trial

## Function
```{python}
def runTrial(target, normal_orientation, window, mouse):
    # define target, normal_orientation, window, mouse as input argument
    
...

runTrial(3, 1, window, mouse)
```

- The best part of it is, you can add multiple trials with adding minimal number of code.

## Function
```{python}
def runTrial(target, normal_orientation, window, mouse):
    ...
    return (response, correctness, RT)
    
...

response, correctness, RT = runTrial(3, 1, window, mouse)
# result = runTrial(3, 1, window, mouse)
```
