```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE)
```

## Previous HomeWork

- Drawing blank screen
```{python}
    window.flip() # refresh the window
    psychopy.core.wait(ISI) # inter-stimuli-interval
```
1. But where to put it.
    + After the stimulus display, of course.
    

2. Identifying which part of the code is responsible of presenting the stimulus.

```{python}
for i in range(setsize):
    stim = psychopy.visual.TextStim(window, text = stimuli[i])
    stim.draw()
    window.flip()
    psychopy.core.wait(display_duration)
```

- Considering adding a comment if you can't identify it.

## Level of Processing

- Typical long-term memory study by Craik & Lockhart (1972)


- Show a long list of words
- After each word display, participants are asked to 'process' the word, e.g., 
    + Phonemic
    + Categorical
    + Sentence
- Later there will be a recall/recognition task.

## Level of Processing

- Let's do a short-term memory version.
- What we have now:

```{r, out.width = "320px", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/sternberg.png")
```

- Add recording after each stimulus display

## Level of Processing

```{python}
response = psychopy.event.waitKeys(keyList = ['c', 'a'])
```

- Previously, we used [waitKeys](http://www.psychopy.org/api/event.html#psychopy.event.waitKeys).
- Let's try it. [level_of_processing1.py](https://github.com/hy-lin/PsychoPy2018/blob/master/Codes/Week5_SchedulingNRecording/level_of_processing1.py)

## Level of Processing

- Problems:
    1. Response isn't accepted during `psychopy.core.wait()` period.
    2. Participants are able to hold on responding to see the stimulus as long as they want.

- Core issue: The display and recording should run parallel. 

## Level of Processing

- Check [psychopy.event.waitKeys](http://www.psychopy.org/api/event.html#psychopy.event.waitKeys).
    + maxWait

```{python}
    stim = psychopy.visual.TextStim(window, text = stimuli[i])
    stim.draw()
    window.flip()
    #psychopy.core.wait(display_duration)
    
    response = psychopy.event.waitKeys(maxWait = display_duration, keyList = ['c', 'a'])
```

- Didn't solve the problem entirely.
- Participants can spam response to shortern the stimulus display

## Level of Processing

- Get the reaction time of the response, and add the missing time back after response.

- There are two ways:
    1. use `timeStamped = True`
    2. use [psychopy.core.getTime](http://www.psychopy.org/api/core.html#psychopy.core.getTime)
    
```{python}
    t0 = psychopy.core.getTime()
    response = psychopy.event.waitKeys(maxWait = display_duration, keyList = ['c', 'a'])
    reaction_time = psychopy.core.getTime() - t0
    psychopy.core.wait(display_duration - reaction_time)
```

- Are we there yet?

## IF

- If participants failed to respond in time, `psychopy.event.waitKeys` returns None instead of actual key press.
- Keep checking if the response is `None`.

```{python}
    if response is None:
        # have to check for more response
    else:
        # don't have to check
```

```{python}
    if response == 'o':
        # participant pressed 'o', do something about this
```

- `is` checks if the variables are referecing to the same object
- `==` checks if the variables have the same value.
- `None` is a special case which you HAVE TO check with is.

## IF

- Other logical operation

```{python}
    response is not None
    response != 'c'
    not response == 'c'
    response == 'c' and response_time < 0.5
    response is None or response_time < 0.1
```

- Back to level of processing experiment

# Surprised Exercise

- Now you know everything you need to finish the experiment.
- DOOOO IIIIIT.

## Level of Processing

```{python}
    window.flip() # present blank screen regardless
    
    if response is None:
        # participant failed to give the response during the stimulus onset
        # keep recording the response
        response = psychopy.event.waitKeys(maxWait = ISI, keyList = ['o', 'n'])
        
        reaction_time = psychopy.core.getTime() - t0
        psychopy.core.wait(ISI - reaction_time - display_duration)
    else:
        # participant gave response during stimulus onset
        # wait patiently
        psychopy.core.wait(ISI)
```

## Level of Processing

- This is not over yet, my summer child.
    + Everytime, `response` and `reaction_time` are overwritten by new input.
    + You have to somehow remember the response and rt.

- Create an (or two) array to store the result.

```{python}
stimuli = ['bent',
           'cart',
           'line',
           'birth',
           'ultra',
           'excuse']
```
    
## No longer a surprise exercise

- That's the homework! Store the response and RT somewhere and output them in the end of experiment.
    + If you are stuck, try to Goole `python how to create an array with n elements`
    + You can use `print` to output.
